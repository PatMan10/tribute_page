        <h2>Here is a time line of Jay-Z's life</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>1969</strong> - Shawn Corey Carter was Born in Brooklyn,
              New York.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Early years</strong> - Shawn was raised in Marcy Houses, a
              housing projects for poor African-Americans. His father, Adnis
              Reeves, abandoned the family leaving Gloria Carter to raise her
              three kids, including Shawn, by herself. Young Shawn, without a
              father figure and a struggling mother of three, was forced to turn
              to street life to survive and make ends meet.
            </p>

            <p>
              He attended several different high schools but did not graduate
              and during this time period he sold crack cocaine to support the
              family. During his years selling drugs he was shot at on three
              occasions, but he was never hit. His time in the drug game taught
              him a wide variety of valuable skills that would serve him later
              in his life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Shawn displayed a talent and passion for rap music from an early
              age. When he wasn't on the streets hustling, he would bang out
              beats and rap to them for hours on end. He even went so far as to
              do this late at night waking up his family members on many
              occasions. His mother took note of this passion and bought him a
              boom box so he could practice more and hopefully stay out of the
              streets. He continued to practice rapping for years and became
              known as "Jazzy" around his neighbourhood, this was the inception
              of Jay-Z.

              <strong>1995-1997</strong> - Jay-Z, a grown man now, fed up with
              the ills of the drug game decided he wanted to pursue a career in

              record companies but failed. Decided to start his own record
              company Roc-A-Fella Records.

              trunk of his car. Eventually he got a distribution deal with
              Priority and released his debut studio album named Reasonable
              Doubt. Album would later be included in Rolling Stone's "500
              Greatest Albums of All Time" as No. 248 and eventually reach
